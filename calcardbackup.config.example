# ---------------------------------------
#
# copy this file to the same directory as calcardbackup.sh
# and change values according to your setup.

# nextcloud_url is mandatory to be configured below.
# Although there is a default value for nextcloud_path, it is a good idea
# to check whether it suits to your setup.
# Rest of the values may stay unchanged. Running the script will give hints,
# if something has to be changed.

# MANDATORY: URL of Nextcloud Login-page:
nextcloud_url="https://www.example.com/"

# absolute path to Nextcloud-Installation:
#nextcloud_path="/usr/share/nginx/www/"

# Is certificate trustful?
# If you have a self signed certificate you may have to change this to "no"
#trustful_certificate="yes"

# Path to file users.txt (see requirements above).
# Relative to scripts directory or absolute path:
#userstxt_path="./"

# Path to folder where backed up files will be saved.
# Relative to scripts directory or absolute path:
#backupfolder="backups/"

# date extension for backup files.
# default is %Y-%m-%d which is YYYY-MM-DD resulting
# in backup files named like "calcardbackup-2017-03-23.tar.gz"
# to change have a look at format options under "man date"
#backupfile_date_extension="-%Y-%m-%d"

# backup nextcloud-database as well?
#backup_database="yes"

# though tested - use at own risk(!):
# delete backups after how many days?
# the default value of "0" means never delete backups
#delete_backups_older_than="0"

# use "zip" instead of "tar.gz" to compress backups?
# (package zip needs to be installed)
#compression_method="zip"

# choose compression level between 1 and 9.
# 1 = faster, bigger filesize
# 9 = slower, smaller filesize
#compression_level="6"
