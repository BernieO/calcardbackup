# config file for script calcardbackup.sh
# ---------------------------------------
#
# copy this file to the same directory as calcardbackup.sh
# and change values according to your setup.
#
# nextcloud_url is mandatory to be configured below.
# The userlist at the end of this file needs to be filled with
# own-/Nextcloud users and their according passwords.
#
# Although there is a default value for nextcloud_path, it is a good idea
# to check whether it suits to your setup.
# Rest of the values may stay unchanged. Running the script will give hints,
# if something has to be changed.

# MANDATORY: URL of Nextcloud Login-page:
nextcloud_url="https://www.example.com/"

# absolute path to Nextcloud-Installation:

#trustful_certificate="yes"

# Path to folder where backed up files will be saved.
# Relative to scripts directory or absolute path:

# to change have a look at format options under "man date"
#backupfile_date_extension="-%Y-%m-%d"

# backup nextcloud-database as well?
#backup_database="yes"

# though tested - use at own risk(!):
# delete backups after how many days?
# the default value of "0" means never delete backups
#delete_backups_older_than="0"

# use "zip" instead of "tar.gz" to compress backups?
# (package zip needs to be installed)
