# ToDos for calcardbackup

- corrections and better explanation in README.md
- corrections and better explanation in config file
- catch if no calendars are in database and print info (currently this results in no user match error)
 
done:
- make text section at top of script shorter (02.04.2017)
- better error handling after url-autodetection, depending on url coming from config file or config.php (overwrite.cli.url) (02.04.2017)
- make declaration of URL optional for versions >=7.0 (there URL can be read from overwrite.cli.url in config.php) (01.04.2017)
- check with regex, that only variables are declared in calcardbackup.config! (30.03.2017)
