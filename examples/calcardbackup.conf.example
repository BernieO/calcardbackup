# example config file for calcardbackup
# ---------------------------------------
#
# This file is only needed, if you don't want to pass options
# on the command line to calcardbackup.
#
# Either copy this file to wherever you want and use option -c|--configfile
# to pass options in this file to calcardbackup.
#
# Only nextcloud_path is mandatory to be configured below.
# Rest of the values may stay unchanged on their default values.
# Running the script will give hints, if something has to be changed.
#
# All paths in this config file need to be relative to this files location or absolute paths!
#
# Don't forget to create file with usernames and according passwords
# with one user per line and separated by a colon.
# See files 'README.md' and 'users.txt.example'
#
# For clarification the according command line options are given in comments.

# path to ownCloud/Nextcloud installation
# this is mandatory:
nextcloud_path="/usr/share/nginx/www/"

# The script tries to automatically detect the URL of ownCloud/Nextcloud,
# which should work in most cases for versions >= 7.0
# For versions < 7.0 this is mandatory!
# correlates to option -a|--address
# URL of Own-/Nextcloud Login-page:
#nextcloud_url="https://www.example.com/"

# Will cURL trust the servers certificate?
# If you have a self signed certificate you might have to change this to "no"
# correlates to option -s|--selfsigned
#trustful_certificate="yes"

# path to file with usernames and passwords (see README.md)
# correlates to option -u|--usersfile
#users_file="users.txt"

# path to folder where backed up files will be saved.
# correlates to option -o|--output
#backupfolder="backups/"

# date extension for backup files. Default is "-%Y-%m-%d" resulting
# in backup files named e.g. "calcardbackup-2017-03-23.tar.gz"
# to change, have a look at format options under "man date"
# correlates to option -d|--date
#date_extension="-%Y-%m-%d"

# choose "yes" if you want to backup nextcloud-database as well:
# correlates to option -q|--database
#backup_database="no"

# though tested - use at own risk(!):
# delete backups after how many days?
# the default value of "0" means never delete backups
# correlates to option -r|--remove
#delete_backups_older_than="0"

# change to "no" to not compress backup files
# find your files then in "backupfolder/calcardbackup-2017-03-23"
# correlates to option -x|--uncompressed
#compress="yes"

# change to "zip" to compress backup as zip (instead of tar.gz)
# package "zip" needs to be installed.
# correlates to option -z|--zip
#compression_method="tar.gz"

# change to "yes" to encrypt backup with GnuPG
# backup will be encrypted symmetric AES256 with given passphrase
# apart from that the passphrase has to be given below
# this correlates to option -e|--encrypt
# If you want to use that:
# pay attention to the comments about encryption in README.md!
#encrypt_backup="no"
#gpg_passphrase="1234"
