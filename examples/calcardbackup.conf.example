# example config file for calcardbackup
# ---------------------------------------
#
# copy this file to the same directory as calcardbackup,
# rename it to calcardbackup.conf and
# change values according to your setup.
#
# nextcloud_url has to be configured below.
# Rest of the values can stay unchanged.
# Running the script will give hints, of something has to be changed.
#
# Don't forget to create file 'users.txt' in scripts dir filled with
# usernames and according passwords with one user per line and
# separated by a colon. See files 'README.md' and 'users.txt.example'

# absolute path to Own-/Nextcloud-Installation:
nextcloud_path="/usr/share/nginx/www/"

# The script tries to automatically detect the URL of Own-/Nextcloud,
# which should work in most cases for versions >= 7.0
# For versions < 7.0 this is mandatory!
# URL of Own-/Nextcloud Login-page:
#nextcloud_url="https://www.example.com/"

# Is certificate trustful?
# If you have a self signed certificate you might have to change this to "no"
#trustful_certificate="yes"

# path to file users.txt (see README.md)
# relative to scripts directory or absolute path
#userstxt_path="./"

# path to folder where backed up files will be saved.
# relative to scripts directory or absolute path:
#backupfolder="backups/"

# date extension for backup files. Default is "-%Y-%m-%d" resulting
# in backup files named e.g. "calcardbackup-2017-03-23.tar.gz"
# to change, have a look at format options under "man date"
#backupfile_date_extension="-%Y-%m-%d"

# choose "yes" if you want to backup nextcloud-database as well:
#backup_database="no"

# though tested - use at own risk(!):
# delete backups after how many days?
# the default value of "0" means never delete backups
#delete_backups_older_than="0"

# in which format should the backup be compressed?
# choose compression method between:
# - "tar.gz": - default
#             - no extra package needs to be installed
# - "tar.xz": - package 'xz-utils' needs to be installed
#             - best compression ratio, but needs time and
#               lots of memory at higher compression levels
# - "zip":    - package 'zip' needs to be installed
#             - is probably most portable
#compression_method="tar.gz"

# choose compression level between 1 and 9
# 1 = faster, bigger filesize
# 9 = slower, smaller filesize
#compression_level="6"

# change to "yes" to run additional commands at certain stages
# see hook.example for explanation and more details
#hook="no"
