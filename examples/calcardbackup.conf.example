# example config file for calcardbackup
# ---------------------------------------
#
# This file is only needed if you don't want to use
# command line options.
#
# You can copy this file to any location, then use option -c|--configfile PATH_TO_FILE ,
# or place this file in working directory or script's directory.
#
# All paths in this config file need to be relative to this files location or absolute paths!
#
# Don't forget to create file "users.txt" with username and corresponding password,
# separated by a colon, one user per line.
# See files 'README.md' and 'users.txt.example'
#
# For clarification, the associated command line options are given in comments.

# path to ownCloud/Nextcloud installation
# this is mandatory:

nextcloud_path="/usr/share/nginx/www/"

# which should work in most cases for versions >= 7.0
# For versions < 7.0 this is mandatory!
# correlates to option -a|--address
# URL of Own-/Nextcloud Login-page:

# the default value of "0" means never delete backups
# correlates to option -r|--remove

#delete_backups_older_than="0"


# uncomment and change to "no" to not compress backup files
# find your files then in a backup directory instead of compressed file
# correlates to option -x|--uncompressed

# give a passphrase in the second line
# to encrypt backup with GnuPG

# correlates to option -e|--encrypt
# pay attention to the comments about encryption in README.md!
